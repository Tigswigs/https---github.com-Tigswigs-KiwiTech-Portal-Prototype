This repository is used to learn the fundamentals of version control GitHub, and the foundations of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment).
The aim is to understand how modern development teams safely store, update, and deploy applications.

## What We Are Practising
- Uploading code to a GitHub repository
- Tracking changes through commits
- Creating and merging branches
- Pulling and pushing updates
- Preparing a project for future CI/CD automation

## Why This Matters
GitHub provides a central place to store and manage code so that:
- No work is lost
- Every update is recorded
- Teams can collaborate easily
- Mistakes can be undone
- New features can be added without breaking the main project

## How CI/CD Fits In
CI/CD is the process of:
- Automatically testing changes (CI)
- Automatically deploying updated applications (CD)
At the end of this exercise, this repository will be connected to a simple CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the website whenever new changes are pushed.

## In Simple Terms
This is what we are practising:
- Saving our work properly
- Sharing our changes safely
- Creating branches smoothly
- Preparing for automation deployment

Everything here is about building confidence with GitHub and learning how real development teams release updates quickly and reliably.
